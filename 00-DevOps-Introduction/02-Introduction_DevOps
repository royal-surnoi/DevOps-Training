### DevOps

DevOps is a process of developing, deploying and testing on the same day. For example if a developer develops 100 lines of code, we can deploy it and test in on the same day. We will get immidiate results, we can fix them. in this process developers, testing and operations guys are working together.

as a DevOps engineer, I can concentrate on faster releases with less defects.
