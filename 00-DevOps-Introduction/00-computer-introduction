### What is computer
    it is a device , which has CPU, RAM , OS and Storage , that must contains IP address, by using IP we can connect the device
### Computer components
- CPU
- RAM
- Hard Disk

### Client Server Architecture
Client: This is like a customer. It asks for something, like opening a website, sending a message, or getting data. Examples are your web browser or mobile app.

Server: This is like a shopkeeper. It listens to the client's requests and provides what is needed, like sending the website data, saving the message, or providing the requested information.

## How it works:
- The client sends a request to the server over the internet (or a network). For example, your browser asks the server to show a website.
- The server processes the request, finds or creates the necessary data, and sends a response back to the client.
- The client receives the response and displays it to the user

### Operating System
An **operating system (OS)** is like the manager of a computer. It helps all the parts of a computer work together and makes it easier for you to use.

### What it does:
1. **Manages hardware:** It controls things like the CPU, memory, and storage so everything runs smoothly.
2. **Runs programs:** It lets you open apps like browsers, games, or word processors.
3. **Connects you to the computer:** It gives you a way to interact with the computer, like clicking on icons or typing commands.

### Examples:
- On phones: Android, iOS
- On computers: Windows, macOS, Linux

In simple terms, an **OS is the software that makes your computer or phone useful and easy to use.** Without it, the device wouldn't know what to do!


### Windows vs Linux
Here's the comparison in a table format:

| **Feature**            | **Windows**                              | **Linux**                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Ownership**          | Owned by Microsoft, requires a license  | Open-source and free to use              |
| **Ease of Use**        | User-friendly with a graphical interface | Can be harder for beginners, but some versions (e.g., Ubuntu) are easy to use |
| **Customization**      | Limited customization                   | Highly customizable                      |
| **Software Compatibility** | Supports most popular software and games | Limited support for mainstream apps, but many free alternatives available |
| **Security**           | More prone to viruses and hacking       | More secure and less targeted by hackers |
